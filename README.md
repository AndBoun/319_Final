# 319_Final

# About the Project:
This is a React website bundled with an Express backend, created as a final project. The project was initially designed to be run with a MongoDB setup, but this version uses local JSON files. Some features, like login and signup, might not work properly.

The website is a crocodile-themed fashion website. You can look at items, add them to your cart, and check out.

## In the .env file

The .env specifies the IP address and port the backend server is running. It also specifies an API key for the chatbot to work.
